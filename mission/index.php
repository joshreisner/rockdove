<b>We want to live in a healthy environment.</b><br />

We want to live in a non-toxic and anti-violent society in which our mental, emotional and spiritual needs are attended to with the same diligence as our physical ones. We regard health and well-being holistically; we know that there is a profound relationship between our ability to understand, impact, and transform our bodily systems and our ability to do the same with our broader social structures.</p>

<p><b>We want to build a liberatory practice.</b><br />

We

believe that leading a liberating way of life is indispensable to

creating a truly revolutionary outcome. Because we know that how we act

is as crucial as the ideals we hold, we share a commitment to using and creating anti-oppressive, anti-hierarchical, horizontal means of achieving our ends both individually and collectively.</p>

<p><b>We want sustainable freedom from our dependency on institutions and individuals that exploit, neglect, and degrade us physically, emotionally, socially and financially.</b><br />

We believe that maintaining a commitment to self-care and to mutual aid is necessary if we are to have a significant effect on our society. We aim to serve as a support network for those working for change within authoritarian structures and those striving to work outside it. We take responsibility for cultivating our own well-being, as well as the well-being of our brothers and sisters in struggle, and of our global community.</p>

<p><b>We want good holistic health care to be made accessible to all people.</b><br />

We believe that every human being, regardless of his or her ethnicity, culture, nationality, economic class, sexual identity, gender or age, has the right to receive quality health care. It is our shared responsibility to ensure access to such services and to work towards dismantling any barriers that stand in the way.
