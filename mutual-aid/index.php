<div class="panel">We encourage mutual aid between our service seekers and providers, our friends and our comrades, our allies and our neighbors.  We believe 

that incorporating mutual aid into our lives will help to set the foundation for a freer and more just world.</div>


<p>The term "mutual aid" has been used in various ways over the past two

centuries by everyone from political theorists to emergency workers.

</p>

However, when we use it, we are referring to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28politics%29"> Wikipedia aptly puts

it</a> "the economic concept of voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources

and services for mutual benefit."   In other words, it's a much fairer

and effective way of giving and receiving services and goods than using

money.   An example of how mutual aid can be used is if I walk Jane

Schmane's dog for an hour, in exchange for one session of

acupuncture.

<br><br>

While we do not directly discourage Seekers from giving money in return

for the services they receive from Providers, as it may be the most

practical means of payment in any given situation, we do encourage

practicing mutual aid, and not just in regards to the health services

facilitated by this collective, but in as many aspects of life as

possible.   Rock Dove believes that by incorporating mutual aid

increasingly into more instances in our lives, it will help to set the foundation

for a freer and more just world.

<b>Using this page</b><br>

We encourage you, our potential service providers, to use this page to

brainstorm and contribute ideas about what types of 

mutual aid might be of interest to you.  We also warmly encourage service seekers to use

this list as a starting point for considering what they might be able to

offer.  The Rock Dove Collective will use your input to guide and inform

our outreach to both service providers and seekers.

<br><br>

Have something in mind?  Please list the type of 

mutual aid with the word "give" or "receive" in parentheses afterward, and the number 1. 

If you already see a service listed, you can just change that "1" to a "2,"

or so on.

<br><br>

Unclear?  Here's an example: if three people wanted to receive dog-walking, and one person 

was able to give it, the list would look like:

<ul>

<li> Dog-walking (give) 1

<li>   Dog-walking (receive) 3

</ul>

Thanks for your (mutual) help!!
