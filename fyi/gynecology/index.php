<div class="panel">You can <a href="gynecologist.pdf">download</a> this tip sheet and take it with you.</div>
<p>All female-bodied people over age 16 are recommended to visit the gynecologist once a year for a check-up.  This should include a
physical exam of the reproductive area and breasts, a Pap smear that checks for cellular changes in the cervix that could signal disease,
STI tests if requested and occasionally a cholesterol check.  On average, female-bodied people in the USA live an average of
three-four years longer than male-bodied folks; this is attributed in part to regular annual visits to the gyno, which can help detect
other health concerns as well.</p>
<p>Here's to staying healthy!</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not have vaginal sex, use spermicidal products, contraceptive foam, douche, lubricants, or any other product in your vagina for at least 
24 hours before the visit, some providers recommend 48 hours.<br><br></li>
<li>If it is your first time seeing a particular provider, try to arrive at least ten minutes early in order to fill out forms. The following
info is good to have on hand:
<ul>
<li>Insurance card (if you have it)</li>
<li>Social security number</li>
<li>Emergency contact info</li>
</ul>
(If you're not comfortable or unable to give the last two, don't
worry about it, a lot of places won't require it although it
might be in your best interest to provide it, especially the
emergency contact.)<br><br></li>
<li>You might need to provide a urine sample, so you might want to drink enough water before hand.<br><br></li>
<li>You can always request that a nurse be present in the room in addition to you and the provider if it makes you more comfortable. Often
providers will request it themselves, but that's usually more to protect themselves from potential harassment lawsuits.<br><br></li>
<li>Be honest with your provider, even if the questions are embarrassing, don't worry about it, chances are they've heard it all
before! And provide all pertinent medical information, even if it's
not asked for.<br><br></li>
<li>During the physical exam of your vagina you can request that the provider set up a mirror so you can see what s/he is seeing.<br><br></li>
<li>Sometimes
      Pap smears can cause a little bit of bleeding (that's normal!)
      so you may want to bring a panty liner to use afterwards, often
      providers will have some on hand.<br><br></li>
<li>Specify
      which sexually transmitted infections (STIs) you want to be tested
      for, sometimes default testing excludes certain ones. FYI, tests
      for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)Â—which can lead to genital
      warts and cervical cancer among other thingsÂ—tends not to be
      covered by insurance, make sure you talk to your insurance provider
      about this before hand if you're interested.<br><br></li>
<li>The
      jury is still out about a uniform way to test for herpes, some
      providers can only test if there are sores present while others do
      blood tests. If this is something you're interested in
      getting, have a detailed conversation with your provider about it.<br><br></li>
<li>ASK
      QUESTIONS!!! Don't be afraid or embarrassed about this, most
      providers prefer that you do so! If they get annoyed with the
      questions you're asking, you probably don't want to
      return to them in the future. Remember, it's your body and
      your health! Take charge of it!!!<br><br></li>
